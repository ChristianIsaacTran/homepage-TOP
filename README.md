# goal of this project in the advanced HTML and CSS course

- In the previous lessons I was taught about responsive HTML and CSS techniques and media queries.
- Ideally, it said that most of the natural responsiveness is using correct semantic HTML tags and attributes. Of course using css built-in formating like grid and flexbox is also encouraged as well.

# recommendations by the project author

- He recommends to go from top to bottom, starting with the larger sections of the layouts. 
- Also notes that it doesn't matter where I start or how I do the responsiveness (such as starting with a mobile layout then using media queries to expand the layout to tablet and PC, or the other way around) as long as it is responsive.
